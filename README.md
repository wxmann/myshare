# myshare
Android app to figure out how much each person has to pay.

Ever ate out with a group of friends, and at the end, you don't know how to split the bill? Some people ordered more expensive dishes. Others ordered a couple of drinks. You ate beforehand: you just picked on a few appetizers. The math you learned in school isn't going to help you out here!

Enter MyShare, an app that calculates, well, your share of the bill. And everyone else's as well.

## In-Progress

Just about everything. Currently still in infancy stages. Developing support for adding amounts by dish, not by person. And then assigning people (or ALL) to dishes.

## Future Improvements

* Integrate with Venmo so the amounts can be directly charged to people.
* Automate input of amounts, possibly by way of scanning bill.
